I was part of the following research projects.

## ANR SUMUM

The [SUMUM](https://anr-sumum.fr) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), aimed to develop strategies for the documentation, conservation, and restoration of cultural heritage.  

**L'Arbre aux Serpents**  

I was part of an [acquisition campaign](https://anr-sumum.fr/campagne-de-captation-dimages-de-larbre-aux-serpents-de-niki-de-saint-phalle-juillet-2018/) for L'Arbre aux Serpents, a sculpture by Niki de Saint Phalle, at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Angers, France.

3D reconstructions (sparse point clouds) obtained using our proposed methods from ICCV 2019 (left) and BMVC 2020 (right). Around 50 images were used to compute these reconstructions.
