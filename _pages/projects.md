I was part of the following research projects.

## ANR SUMUM

The [SUMUM](https://anr-sumum.fr) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), aimed to develop strategies for the documentation, conservation, and restoration of cultural heritage.  

**L'Arbre aux Serpents**  

I was part of an [acquisition campaign](https://anr-sumum.fr/campagne-de-captation-dimages-de-larbre-aux-serpents-de-niki-de-saint-phalle-juillet-2018/) for L'Arbre aux Serpents, a sculpture by Niki de Saint Phalle, at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Angers, France.  

Below is a 3D reconstruction (sparse point cloud) of the sculpture obtained using our autocalibration method from BMVC 2020, computed from around 50 images.

## EU H2020 Endomapper

The [Endomapper](https://sites.google.com/unizar.es/endomapper/home) project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, aimed to advance the theory and practice of real-time localization and mapping within the human body, using only a standard monocular endoscope.  

**Internships**

I supervised two Master's students at the University of Clermont Auvergne during the project:  

- Youssef Ezidi (April-September 2024): developed a graphical user interface for point tracking in endoscopy images.
- Timothé Chavant-Duché (May-July 2024): worked on segmenting specular highlights in endoscopy images.
