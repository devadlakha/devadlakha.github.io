I was part of the following research projects.

## ANR SUMUM

The [SUMUM](https://anr-sumum.fr) project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), aimed to develop strategies for the documentation, conservation, and restoration of cultural heritage.  

**L'Arbre aux Serpents**  

I was part of an [acquisition campaign](https://anr-sumum.fr/campagne-de-captation-dimages-de-larbre-aux-serpents-de-niki-de-saint-phalle-juillet-2018/) for L'Arbre aux Serpents, a sculpture by Niki de Saint Phalle, at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Angers, France.
