I am a Computer Vision researcher specializing in 3D Computer Vision (image-based 3D reconstruction of rigid/deformable objects). My work has particularly focused on the mathematical modeling and optimization aspects of 3D reconstruction problems. Some applications include cultural heritage, augmented reality, digital healthcare, and robotics. 

I received my PhD from the [University of Strasbourg](https://en.unistra.fr) in France, and I was advised by [Adlane Habed](https://habed.weebly.com), [Fabio Morbidi](https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~fabio/Index.html), [CÃ©dric Demonceaux](https://sites.google.com/view/cedricdemonceaux/home), and [Michel de Mathelin](https://rdh.icube.unistra.fr/Michel_de_Mathelin_personal_web_page). My [PhD research](https://publication-theses.unistra.fr/public/theses_doctorat/2022/ADLAKHA_Devesh_2022_ED269.pdf) was on camera autocalibration, a classic yet still challenging problem in Computer Vision. 

I did a postdoc at the [University of Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/en) in France, where I worked with [Adrien Bartoli](https://encov.ip.uca.fr/ab/). My research was on the 3D reconstruction of non-rigid objects, focusing on camera calibration in a deformable scene. I also collaborated with [Shaifali Parashar](https://shaifaliparashar.github.io) and [Daniel Pizarro](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Daniel-Pizarro-Perez/).

I am looking for opportunities in Computer Vision in both academia/industry. I will be glad to discuss potential opportunities, and computer vision and research in general. Feel free to get in touch!
