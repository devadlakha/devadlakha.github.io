I'm a researcher in computer vision, focusing on 3D computer vision problems (image-based 3D reconstruction of rigid/deformable objects). I am particularly interested in the mathematical modeling and optimization aspects of these problems. Some applications of my research include in cultural heritage, augmented reality, and robotics. 

I received my PhD from the [University of Strasbourg](https://en.unistra.fr) in France, and I was advised by [Adlane Habed](https://habed.weebly.com), [Fabio Morbidi](https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~fabio/Index.html), [CÃ©dric Demonceaux](https://sites.google.com/view/cedricdemonceaux/home), and [Michel de Mathelin](https://rdh.icube.unistra.fr/Michel_de_Mathelin_personal_web_page). My PhD research was on camera autocalibration, a classic and well-studied (yet still challenging) problem in geometric computer vision. 

I did a postdoc at the [University of Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/en) in France, working with [Adrien Bartoli](https://encov.ip.uca.fr/ab/). My research was on the 3D reconstruction of non-rigid objects, focusing on camera calibration in a deformable scene. I also collaborated with [Shaifali Parashar](https://shaifaliparashar.github.io) and [Daniel Pizarro](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Daniel-Pizarro-Perez/).

I'm looking for research opportunities in 3D computer vision in both academia/industry. I'll be glad to discuss opportunities, and computer vision and research in general, feel free to contact me!
