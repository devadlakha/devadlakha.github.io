## Robot vision

Earlier work on computer vision for robotics from before my PhD.

**Package delivery with a camera drone**

This work was part of my internship at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home/), TU Graz, where I worked with [Friedrich Fraundorfer](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-fraundorfer/people/friedrich-fraundorfer/) and his research group. This demo with an industrial partner showcased autonomous package delivery using a camera drone. It involved the following autonomously performed tasks: taking off from a stationary vehicle, navigating to the delivery site, landing and dropping the package, flying back to the distribution vehicle, following the vehicle as it moved, and finally landing when the vehicle was stationary. I worked on robust camera pose estimation and tag detection.

**Visual contact with cadioptric cameras**

This work was from a two-month summer internship at [MIS lab](https://www.mis.u-picardie.fr), University of Picardie Jules Verne, where I worked with [CÃ©dric Demonceaux](https://sites.google.com/view/cedricdemonceaux/home) and [El Mustapha Mouaddib](https://home.mis.u-picardie.fr/~mouaddib/index.php?page=accueil) in the Robotic Perception group. The group specializes in omnidirectional vision and had published a method for time-to-contact estimation using a central catadioptric camera. In my internship, I implemented and tested this method using a Pioneer 3-AT mobile robot. The main tools used were ROS and OpenCV. I also showed example applications of this method, including depth computation and vision-based braking. More details and results in the slides (quality may be a bit poor due to conversion from PDF) and the report.
