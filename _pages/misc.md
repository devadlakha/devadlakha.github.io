This work was part of my internship at the [Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/home/), TU Graz, where I worked with [Friedrich Fraundorfer](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-fraundorfer/people/friedrich-fraundorfer/) and his research group. This demo with an industrial partner showcased autonomous package delivery using a camera drone. It involved the following autonomously performed tasks: taking off from a stationary vehicle, navigating to the delivery site, landing and dropping the package, flying back to the distribution vehicle, following the vehicle as it moved, and finally landing when the vehicle was stationary. I worked on robust camera pose estimation and tag detection.
