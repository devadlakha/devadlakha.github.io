This was a demo with an industrial partner showcasing autonomous package delivery using a camera drone. The demo involved the following autonomously performed tasks: taking-off from a stationary vehicle, navigating to the delivery site, landing and dropping the package, flying back to the distribution vehicle, following the moving vehicle, and finally landing when the vehicle is stationary again. I worked on robust camera pose estimation and tag detection.
