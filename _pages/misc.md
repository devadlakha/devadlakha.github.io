Work from my internship at the Institute of Ccomputer Graphics and Vision, TU Graz working with [Friedrich Fraundorfer](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-fraundorfer/people/friedrich-fraundorfer/). This was a demo with an industrial partner showcasing autonomous package delivery using a camera drone. The demo involved the following autonomously performed tasks: taking-off from a stationary vehicle, navigating to the delivery site, landing and dropping the package, flying back to the distribution vehicle, following the vehicle as it moves, and finally landing when the vehicle is stationary. I worked on robust camera pose estimation and tag detection.
